WELCOME to this Trading analysis project

In this project we had created a graphical User Interface, where user can fill the data and after filling all the spaces, when user click on submit button that data is going to save in 
excel and csv file and on behalf of profit or loss entered by the user the cell colour in excel changes (Green / Red) accordingly.

Above are some packages which are used in our project.
Go to command prompt and type:
